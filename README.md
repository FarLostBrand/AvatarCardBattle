# Avatar Card Battle
This was created for my Web Dev 1 Final Project.  
**This is a non-commercial creation.**

---

# How to Play
Each player chooses an avatar, with each avatar type having its own ability.  
After both players choose an avatar, it's battle time.  
Both players will take turns picking a certain amount of cards from the deck.  
They will have the ability to draw and/or shuffle the deck if they please.  
Players will be able to use their ability on their turn if the conditions are met.
